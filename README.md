# 👋 Hi there! I'm MOXIE (OJO OLUWADAMILARE SAMUEL)

🎓 I'm a Computer Engineering student at Redeemer's University, Ede, Nigeria.

💻 I love building things that blend **software** and **hardware** — from embedded systems to mobile and web applications.

🔧 I'm currently exploring:
- **Flutter** for mobile app development
- **Web design** using HTML, CSS, and modern frameworks
- **Embedded systems** and microcontroller programming

🛠️ Languages I'm learning:
- C, C++, Python, Dart, HTML & CSS  
(I’m not fluent in all yet — but I’m committed to growing 💪)

🌱 I’m always learning and open to collaboration on beginner-friendly open-source and embedded systems projects.

📬 How to reach me:

- Email: [samuelayomideojo9@gmail.com]

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy understanding *how things work* at both the hardware and software levels.
